=== Cryptographic controls

==== Policy on the use of cryptographic controls

A policy should be setup based on what cryptographic controls a SaaS service should support for eligibility.

If a SaaS service does not support the designated cryptographic control, what are the mitigation measures.

* What data needs to be verified in terms of integrity (hashing) and confidentiality (encryption)
* What role should the provider play: would the provider have access to the encrypted data? Would the provider have to collude with another provider to do so? Or the provider cannot have access to the data.

=== Key management

If the SaaS service supports usage of customer keys, procedures and auditing trails should be setup to monitor usage of these keys.
