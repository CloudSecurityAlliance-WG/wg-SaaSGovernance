=== Technical vulnerability management

Define responsibilities for vulnerability management.

For organizations using cloud resources over SaaS, controlling security can be challenging in some cases. For example, a SaaS customer may not be able to mitigate known vulnerabilities of a SaaS application if it is severe and out of the customer's reach.

There are cases, however, where customers can mitigate risks. Consider the case when a SaaS application accepts a weak TLS cipher: the customer's policy could enforce all its users to use a more resilient cipher on connections to this SaaS, thereby mitigating this vulnerability until it is ultimately resolved.

==== Management of technical vulnerabilities

* Manage and track vulnerabilities affecting SaaS customer usage
* Procedure for tracking and escalating problems to SaaS provider
* Mitigate existing problems and manage usage to affected areas

==== Restrictions on software installation
