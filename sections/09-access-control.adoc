== Access control

=== Business requirements of access control

==== Access control policy

* Evaluate whether person needs access to this
* Identify business requirements and role
* Information clearance based on data classification
* Approval by security review and data owner (sponsor)

Users in organizations are typically granted access to applications based on historical events or by cloning the access rights of their peers.

Therefore it is important to evaluate whether a person genuinely needs access to a service and to identify the business requirements and establish roles.

==== Access to networks and network services


=== User access management

==== User registration and deregistration

User awareness is vital: you need to help the business understand their security problems, and help them understand how their role will help them solve it.

==== User access provisioning

* User training on best practices
* Awareness on acceptable use, relevant policies and procedures
* Create account according to user access baseline
* Least privilege
* Billing party: group or sponsor based on usage?
* Identify and set resource limits

Always follow the concept of least privilege and identify and set resource limits.

==== Management of privileged access rights

==== Management of secret authentication information

==== Review of user access rights

==== Removal or adjustment of access rights

* Ensure immediate account termination without residual
* Halts resource billing related to account
* Audit logs and access logs must be kept
* Security review if necessary
* Update account termination logs and inventory

Ensure audit logs are reviewed and retained.

And finally, ensure billing is halted when resources are no longer used. Do this in an automated fashion and try to eliminate any manual actions.

=== User responsibilities

==== Use of secret authentication information

==== Monitoring of user access

* Set monitoring alerts based on basic usage profile
* Alert on suspicious login (e.g., location, time) and data access (e.g., batch access)
* Adherence to password policies
* Data loss prevention

Setup alerts and monitor suspicious behavior and logins.
